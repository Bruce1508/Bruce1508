# 👋 Hey, I’m Bruce.

When I wrote my first “Hello World,” I didn’t realize I was opening a door to something that would change how I see the world — one line of code at a time.  
Back then, I wasn’t chasing fancy frameworks or perfect syntax. I was chasing that feeling of *“wow, this actually works.”*  
That spark hasn’t faded since.

### 🌱 The journey so far
I started out just wanting to build things — small, messy, half-working projects that somehow *did* something.  
Then curiosity took over. I wanted to know *why* things worked, *how* systems connected, and *what* made a great user experience feel effortless.

That curiosity turned into obsession, and now I spend my days designing and building full-stack web apps — not just to make things run, but to make them *feel right*.

### 💡 What I believe
I’ve learned that good development is equal parts logic and empathy.  
You’re not just writing functions — you’re solving someone’s frustration, making their workflow smoother, or helping them see data in a way that suddenly makes sense.

And honestly, that’s what keeps me coming back to the keyboard every day. It’s not about pushing code; it’s about *crafting experiences*.

### 🚀 Right now
These days, I’m exploring:
- How to make the web faster and simpler for real users  
- How to design systems that are reliable but still flexible  
- How to keep learning — even when I think I already “get it”

Because the moment you stop learning in tech… you’re already behind.
